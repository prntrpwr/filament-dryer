# RANDOM THOUGHTS
- Use old ATMega2560 with RAMPS controller.  Gives 5V and heater/fan control
	- But don't use Marlin firmware or GCode; custom firmware only
- Build an I2C hub for all sensors, use connectors so sensors can be moved/replaced/etc
- better to get a single, quality, US made differential pressure sensor, or multiple cheap chinese ones?
